# MyWebApp

My Web App will eventually act as an instant courier service that any one can sign up to use or work for (Like Uber)


At the moment you can add, delete, find one and find all, and increment job Offers of my job collectiion
I can also add, delete and find users

I plan on making it so each job has a relevant user, ie. a user will ost a job.

I will also be adding another collection called Couries, where a courier can select a job and make a job offer.
